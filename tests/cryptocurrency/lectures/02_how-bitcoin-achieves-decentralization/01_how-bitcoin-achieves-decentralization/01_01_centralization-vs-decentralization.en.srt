00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,022
Hello, and welcome to the second lecture,

3
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:21,390
which is going to be all about
decentralization in Bitcoin.

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,940
Now, in the first lecture you saw a lot of
the crypto basics that underlie Bitcoin

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,040
and we ended with a simple currency
that we called Scrooge coin.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,780
That seems to achieve a lot of what we
want in a ledger based crypto currency,

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,900
except for one big glaring problem,

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,800
which is that it relies upon
the centralized authority called Scrooge.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,610
And we end it with the question of,
how do we de-scroogify this currency?

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,440
How do we go to a decentralized
version of this?

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,340
That's what we're gonna see today.

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,300
What I find cool about this is that
the way in which Bitcoin achieves

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,960
decentralization is not
purely technical but

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,421
it's a combination of technical and
clever incentive engineering.

15
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:02,957
And, at the end of this lecture, you
should have a really good appreciation for

16
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:07,920
how this happens asnd a lot of
the magic or mystery of Bitcoin should

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,850
become clear to you and how it works and
why it's secure, and what makes it tick.

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,720
So it turns out that decentralization
is an important concept, not just for

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,686
Bitcoin but in fact, this notion of
competing paradigms of centralization

20
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:27,793
versus decentralization plays out in a
variety of different digital technologies.

21
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:31,645
To understand Bitcoin's decentralization,
I want to start with the caveat

22
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:35,385
that decentralization almost
always is not all or nothing.

23
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:39,590
Almost no system is purely decentralized
or purely centralized and a good example

24
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,420
of this is email, which is a decentralized
system, fundamentally, I would say.

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,570
It's based on a standard spaced protocol,
SMTP.

26
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,990
But, what has happened,
especially in the last decade or

27
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,490
so, is that we see a dominance of
a few different web mail providers,

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,830
which are sort of centralized
service providers.

29
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,510
And this might be a good model for

30
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,649
understanding what might
be happening to Bitcoin.

31
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,690
So with that,

32
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,780
let's delve into some the technical
aspects of Bitcoin's decentralization and

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,310
I would break this down into at
least five different questions.

34
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,460
Questions like,
who maintains this ledger of transactions?

35
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,970
Who has authority over which
transactions are valid?

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,510
Who creates new Bitcoins?

37
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,890
And in fact, other questions like,

38
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,250
who determines how the rules
of the system change?

39
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,009
And how do Bitcoins
acquire exchange value?

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,220
So these are all components of
decentralization of the Bitcoin protocol,

41
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,170
more or less.

42
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,300
And the first three of
these are going to be

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,290
questions that we will
consider in this lecture.

44
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,820
And when I say how is
Bitcoin decentralized,

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,580
what I mean encompasses the first
three of these meanings.

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,290
And I want to emphasize that there
are aspects to decentralization

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,730
beyond the protocol that includes
things like Bitcoin exchanges,

48
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,420
where you can convert Bitcoin
into other currencies.

49
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,550
It includes things like
wallet software and

50
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,510
a variety of other service providers and

51
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,790
so, even though the underlying protocol
is decentralized, these services that

52
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,929
develop on top of it may be centralized or
decentralized, to varying degrees.

53
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,450
And just to drive home this point,
let me show you three different aspects

54
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,760
of Bitcoin and where they fall on the
centralization, decentralization spectrum.

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,940
First, there's the peer to peer
network and this aspect of Bitcoin,

56
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,720
I would say, is the closest
thing to purely decentralized.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,570
Why is that?

58
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,430
Because anybody can run a Bitcoin node,
and there's a fairly low barrier to entry.

59
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,460
You can go online, you can download
a Bitcoin client yourself.

60
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,210
It requires a lot of disconsumption
on your computer, but

61
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,680
basically you can run that on your
laptop or your PC yourself and

62
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,080
currently there are several
thousand Bitcoin nodes.

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,220
And so this really resembles a peer
to peer decentralized system.

64
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,300
But that's not the only
component of Bitcoin.

65
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,660
There's also Bitcoin mining, which
we'll study later in this lecture and

66
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,260
Bitcoin mining is technically
also open to anyone.

67
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,540
But it turns out that it requires
a very high capital cost.

68
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,710
It's a consequence of how
the system happens to have evolved.

69
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,785
And because of this,
there has been a high centralization or

70
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:06,490
a concentration of power in
the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, and

71
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,560
the community frequently sees
this as quite undesirable.

72
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,420
So this aspect of Bitcoin is not quite as
decentralized as one might want it to be.

73
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,980
And, here's a third aspect,
updates to the software.

74
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,630
And this really gets to how and
when rules of the system change.

75
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,535
And once again here, one can conceptually
imagine that everybody running a Bitcoin

76
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:28,946
node will look at the Bitcoin
specification, and maybe even create their

77
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:32,280
own software and again,
you have a purely decentralized system.

78
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,670
But of course,
that's not how it works in practice.

79
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,516
The core developers are really
trusted by the community,

80
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:40,418
and they have a lot of power when
it comes to determining what

81
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:43,630
Bitcoin software each of these
nodes will run on their computer.
